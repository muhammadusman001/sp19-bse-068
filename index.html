            <h3>USMAN</h3>
          <p>A paragraph may be well described as a group of several well organized, complete, correct, and concise sentences combined together focusing on one subject, theme, or central idea. It can be an independent short composition written on certain central idea or it may also be a part of lengthy composition like essay, story or any kind of prose/poetry work. In lengthy composition paragraphs are made to make the  long write-ups easily comprehendible.  As far as length of a paragraph is concerned there is no set rule for it. They may be from one to many lines long.</p>

          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>MUSA</h3>
            <p>The first and foremost principle to be followed while constructing a good paragraph is the Unity. Paragraphs should be so framed that it must deal with one topic or idea. Every sentence in the paragraph must be closely connected with the main theme of the paragraph. The theme of the paragraph is generally expressed in first sentence-known as topical sentence/title- of the paragraph</p>
            <p>Varity is considered as the soul of a good paragraph. It mean that the paragraph should be so fabricated that it should contain all type of small and big sentence sans any kind of repetitive words in them. Varity of sentences make a paragraph look good and well knitted.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
            <h3>ALI</h3>        
           <p>The second most important principle leading to a good piece of paragraph is that all the sentences expressing main theme of the paragraph should be arranged in a proper sequence and logical manner. All the ideas expressed in these sentences should be connected with the leading idea and arranged according to their importance in the paragraph.

            Like the two most important sentences in the paragraph i.e the first sentence-by rule the topical sentence â€“ should arouse the curiosity in the mind of the reader and the last sentence should bring the whole paragraph to a logical conclusion.</p>
